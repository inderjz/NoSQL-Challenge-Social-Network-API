  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)

  My Project is a backend program for an online store that communicates with a MySQL database using Sequelize. A user may browse the items, categories, and tags using insomnia, as well as modify the database using CRUD operations.

  I created this project to help stores that sell stuff online for example clothing.

  Anyone can use this project for their online store.

  ## [Installation](#table-of-contents)
